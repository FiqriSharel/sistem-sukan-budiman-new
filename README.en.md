# Kampung Budiman Community Sports Participant Registration System

This is a participant registration system for the Kampung Budiman Sukan Rakyat / Sukan SULAM event. Public participants can register through a QR-code-accessible link without logging in, receive a unique registration code, and check their registration status. Participants cannot edit their own submitted details; any correction must be handled by the admin.

## Tech Stack

- Laravel 12
- PHP 8.2+
- MySQL/MariaDB for production
- SQLite for local development if preferred
- Blade templates
- Tailwind CSS
- Flowbite
- Vite
- Laravel Breeze authentication

## Installation

```bash
composer install
npm install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

## `.env` Setup

For MySQL/MariaDB:

```env
APP_NAME="Sukan Budiman"
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=sukan_budiman
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

For local SQLite:

```env
DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
```

If using SQLite, make sure `database/database.sqlite` exists.

## Database Setup

```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

The seeders create:

- Default admin user
- Sample sports houses
- Initial Sukan SULAM sports/events

## Default Admin Login

- Email: `admin@budiman.test`
- Password: `password`

Change this password before using the system in a real event.

## Production Admin Account

After deployment, create a real admin account through Tinker:

```bash
php artisan tinker
```

Then run the following command. Replace the email and password with the real production credentials:

```php
\App\Models\User::create([
    'name' => 'Admin',
    'email' => 'admin@example.com',
    'password' => \Illuminate\Support\Facades\Hash::make('your-secure-password'),
]);
```

If the default admin account already exists and only needs to be changed to a real email:

```php
$user = \App\Models\User::where('email', 'admin@budiman.test')->first();

$user->update([
    'name' => 'Admin',
    'email' => 'real-admin@example.com',
    'password' => \Illuminate\Support\Facades\Hash::make('your-secure-password'),
]);
```

After that, log in through `/login` with the real admin email. Use a strong production password and do not keep `password` as the admin password.

## Run Locally

```bash
npm run dev
php artisan serve
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

For production asset build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Current Limitations

- No paid SMS or WhatsApp API integration.
- Full role management with Spatie Laravel Permission is not installed because the current version only needs a basic admin user.

## Future Improvements

- QR code generator for the `/daftar` registration link.
- Additional roles such as registration crew or event coordinator.
